## Simple Library Management is an _Open Source_ Website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

A **Simple library management** project that is easy to use and helps learners understand the basic concept of JS. In this project, the user has a provision to add book details like book name, author name, and type through the web page. In addition to this, the user has a provision to search for the available books in the library by the book name or author name, or type. If book details are present in the **LocalStorage**, the search details are displayed on the web page. User has also a provision to **delete** a specific book or **delete** all books. 

In this project, you will learn how to implement **_add, remove/delete, search, and save functionalities_**. You will also learn how to deploy, or publish, your web site to Azure so that you can show it off to your friends.
