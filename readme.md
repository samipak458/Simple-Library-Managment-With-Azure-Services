<h1> Simple Library Management </h1>
</div>

A simple library management project is an **Open Source Website** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** and **Bootstrap** and is **easy to use** and helps learners understand the **basic concept of JS**. In this project, the user has a provision to add book details like book name, author name, book URL, ISBN, edition, publication date, the status of reading the book, and book genre through the web page. In addition, the user has a provision to search for the available books in the library by the book name, author name, or type. If book details are present in the LocalStorage, the search details are displayed on the web page. Users also have a provision to delete a specific book or all books. The user can choose his favorites and edit any book details very quickly.

In this project, you will learn how to implement add, remove/delete, search, and save functionalities. You will also learn how to deploy, or publish, your web site to Azure so that you can show it off to your friends.

# Visit Website:

You can try the website at [Online Library](https://delightful-coast-00b51a700.1.azurestaticapps.net/)

## Functionalities :

Input the book Name, Author, URL, Edition, ISBN, Publication Date, Status, and Book Type to add the book. If the book name is **missing**, it will show you an error. As I used LocalStorage, if you **refresh** or **close** the tab, your **books** will **not disappear**. You can clear the bookshelf just by clicking on clear shelf. You can also search books by book name, author, and type.
